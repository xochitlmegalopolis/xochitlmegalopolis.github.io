        <u>ALL OF US have the power</u> to create reality. <br />
        We do it through words; we do it through stories; <br />
        we do it through our thoughts, our credences, and our imaginations. <br />
        The mechanism is simple: if people <u>believe</u> that something is true <br />
    {'{'}create a story about it being true{'}'} then they will <u>act</u> as if it is true. <p />
        And this changes the way things are. <p />
        There might be times in which we run up against an external reality <br />
        that denies us; for example, no matter how much we believe we can fly, <br />
        when we jump off a bridge we will hit water below. <p />
        Gravity denies us. <p />
        We generally call this sort of phenomenon a <u>delusion</u>;<br />
        it is what happens when a person's beliefs run up against <br />
        some contrary commonality, <br />
        something that every person and thing would experience equally, <br />
        under similar circumstances, with no known exceptions. <p />
        Be that as it may, <br />
        There ARE certain circumstances under which humans CAN fly, <br />
        so you can already see how a "delusional" belief <br />
        has the potential to insert itself into reality. <br />
        It is not really delusional to believe you can fly; <br />
        it is delusional specifically to believe you can fly <br /> 
        under <u>certain circumstances</u>, <br />
        namely, by jumping off a bridge and flapping your arms like a bird. <br />
        Then again, it is possible that the person engaging in this behavior <br />
        might <u>interpret</u> their free-fall into the water as a kind of <br />
        <u>symbolic</u> flight, since we as humans have the capacity <br />
        to use symbols to stand in for and represent reality; <p />
        and then it would be true <br />
        that they <u>were</u>, in fact, flying in <u>a sense</u> -- <br />
        that is, mythologically flying. <p />
        Hardly anyone would probably agree to join them in this mythological interpretation, <br />
        thus such a person would likely remain classified as "delusional". <br />
        But say they were part of a cult, tribe, or religion, for whom the jump was a ritual<br />
        interpreted as a "spiritual flight"; <br />
        then the delusion would take on a sort of social, symbolic reality. <br />
        They might speak of the "flight" among themselves for years to come, <br />
        and it would be real simply because the word "flight" is itself a symbol <br />
        that refers to an idea, whose definition and interpretation is subject to <br />
        the whims of its users. So we see that not only does the distinction between "delusion" <br />
        and "reality" depend on the circumstances surrounding a belief, <br />
        but also on the way we choose to <u>interpret</u> and <u>define</u> our symbols. <p />
        And this is how reality is created. <p />
        A fantastic example is money. <br />
        For all intents and purposes, money is nothing more than a collective hallucination. <br />
        These days money is most often imagined in the form of numbers on a screen; <br />
        but sometimes it is found in paper notes or metal coins. <br /> 
        These things have little-to-no inherent value. <br />
        They are merely <u>symbols</u> of value. <br />
        They are symbols which represent raw materials, food, housing, labor, <br />
        and other goods and services -- things we need and desire. <br />
        But no one would deny that money is real, and that it's powerful -- <br />
        indeed, it's one of the most powerful things in this world. <br />
        No one would say you are "delusional" for believing that some pieces of paper <br />
        or some screen-numbers are worth the equivalent of a meal or a day's work. <br />
        But the only reason this paper or those screen-numbers are worth anything at all <br />
        is because we all collectively agree to <u>believe</u> they are. <br />
        The cashier at the coffee shop, the store owner, the landlord and the government <br />
        all <u>believe</u> that this "money" is worth the services and goods they exchange for it. <p />
        But the circumstances matter a great deal. <p />
        A coffee shop in Tokyo likely won't give you a latte <br />
        in exchange for Peruvian soles -- even though they'd surely <br />
        acknowledge that the soles are, in fact, "money", <br />
        accepted and exchanged by the people of Perú. <br /> 
        Italian lire are "money", just as much as are ancient Roman denarii, <br /> 
        but no one besides coin collectors and a few archaeologists <br />
        believes either of these currencies have value anymore. <br />
        On the other hand, Monopoly money is exchanged around the world <br />
        in the context of a board game, but no baker or butcher would ever take them <br />
        for a loaf of bread or salami. People only "believe" in their value <br />
        under a specific, and extremely limited, set of circumstances. <p />
        Even counterfeit bills, which would look to most observers <br />
        nearly exactly like the currencies they are created to emulate, <br />
        are not "believed" to have value because they are not issued <br />
        by the relevant authority. <p />
        In addition to the circumstances surrounding our belief in money, <br />
        we have the <u>symbolism</u> or the <u>interpretation</u>,<br />
        or what we believe constitutes the idea of money. <br />
        Though individuals might differ in their precise analyses, <br />
        on the collective level we have a vague sort of "definition" <br />
        of what can and cannot be labeled with that concept. <br /> 
        For example, most of us would agree that seashells <br />
        should not be classified as money, even though we know <br />
        that is completely arbitrary because indigenous Americans <br />
        once used them that way. <p />
        So we see that not only context, but concept, plays a role <br />
        in delineating what we experience as reality; <br />
        and that, while there is an external, objective component involved, <br />
        there is much room for subjective experience and mythology <br />
        to shape that experience. <p />
        It is precisely this that the gods realized in the creation myth <br />
        of the Huicholes of México; that whatever they dreamed would become real. <p />
        And so they dreamed of flowers and hills, rocks, rivers and trees, <br />
        meadows and forests; and the world blossomed into being <br />
        as they wandered through it, imagining and creating. <p />
        They had the advantage of being gods, and therefore of not having <br />
        any prior-existing external reality to reckon with; <br />
        whereas we exist in a world full of other objects and spirits <br />
        which all play their part in contributing to the story. <p />
        So that's just the thing: though we all have the power to create reality, <br />
        none of us has the <u>sole and exclusive power</u> <br />
        to shape a singular <u>external</u> reality. <p />
        We share that power with everthing else <br />
        in this universe. <p />
        Nevertheless, whosoever realizes that they do, in fact, <br />
        have such a power, can become quite god-like, indeed; <br />
        particularly, if they can persuade other people to accept <br />
        <u>their</u> version of things -- or to give up their own. <br />
